Alytus is a city with municipal rights in southern Lithuania.  
It is the sixth-largest city in Lithuania and the 14th-largest city in the Baltic states, and also the capital of Alytus County.

Being the historical centre of the DzÅ«kija region, it is connected to several major roads, linking it with the cities of Vilnius; Kaunas; Lazdijai (on the border with Poland); and Grodno, Belarus.

In July 2024, its total population was counted as 50,996 people.

The city lies on the banks of the Nemunas River.

For centuries, the city was divided into two separate entities. Even today, it consists of two parts still frequently referred to as Alytus I and Alytus II.

The Alytus I half is smaller and less developed than the Alytus II half, which forms the city centre with parks, microdistricts, and industrial areas.
